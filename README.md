This is a giveaway / anything text-related on screen script

basically works by taking screenshots every <__> seconds, parsing text and seeing if anything matches the thing that you put in

works in inf loop

allows you to customize what it does when it finds something 

you do have to keep the tab on which the text will show up open at all times otherwise the script will take screenshot from wrong thing and break
